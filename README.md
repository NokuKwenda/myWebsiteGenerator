Hi Everyone! This is an example of a very beginner programmer, who has been diligently studying html, css and javascript. 
No tutorial was followed, as i drafted this idea (though probably not completely original) by myself.
This project took me about 3-4 hours to complete.
This project proceeded a very simple login form I had created, to begin to exercise my coding muscles.
For components of css I wasn't sure how to implement, I used mdn web docs to look up functions.
The same was applied with javascript, alongside w3schools.
